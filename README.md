- Output interpretation guides

**Data:**

- Cat/Dog training images (for classification algorithms)
- Test images (0.jpg to 9.jpg)
- Sample matrices (for PCA and SVD)

## How to Run

**Setup:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MLLab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run Algorithms:**

```bash
python svm.py        # Support Vector Machine
python bayesian.py   # Bayesian Classification
python lda.py        # Linear Discriminant Analysis
python least_square.py # Least Squares
python pca.py        # Principal Component Analysis
python svd.py        # Singular Value Decomposition
```

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies: numpy, opencv-python, scikit-learn, scipy

Each script runs independently and produces immediate results.
