# PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Implementation - README

## What is PCA?

PCA is a **dimensionality reduction technique** that finds the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data. It transforms data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information (variance).

### Key Concepts:

- **Principal Components**: Orthogonal directions of maximum variance
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce features while keeping important patterns
- **Variance Preservation**: Keep the most informative directions
- **Data Compression**: Represent data with fewer dimensions
- **Noise Reduction**: Remove less important variations

## How This Simple PCA Works

### Input Data

```python
# Example: 6 samples × 4 features
X = np.array([
    [1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0],  # Sample 1
    [2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0],  # Sample 2
    [3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0],  # Sample 3
    [4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0],  # Sample 4
    [5.0, 6.0, 3.0, 4.0],  # Sample 5
    [6.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0],  # Sample 6
])
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Data Preparation**

- Start with matrix X (6 samples × 4 features)
- Each row = one sample, each column = one feature
- PCA automatically centers the data (subtracts mean)

#### 2. **Find Principal Components**

```python
pca = PCA(n_components=2)  # Reduce to 2 dimensions
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)
```

- Computes directions of maximum variance
- Returns transformed data in new coordinate system

#### 3. **Analyze Results**

- **Transformed Data**: New coordinates in principal component space
- **Variance Explained**: How much information each component captures
- **Reconstruction**: Can recover approximate original data

## Understanding the Output

### Sample Output Explanation

```
Original matrix shape: (6, 4)
```

- **6 samples** with **4 features** each
- Need to reduce from 4D to 2D

```
Reduced shape: (6, 2)
```

- Same 6 samples but now only **2 features** (principal components)
- Achieved 50% reduction in dimensions

```
Transformed data:
[[-3.276, -1.254]
 [-2.621,  1.299]
 [-0.667, -0.573]
 [ 0.327,  1.277]
 [ 2.791, -1.651]
 [ 3.446,  0.902]]
```

- **New coordinates** for each sample in principal component space
- PC1 (first column): Most important direction
- PC2 (second column): Second most important direction

```
Variance explained: [0.749, 0.173]
```

- **PC1 captures 74.9%** of total variance in data
- **PC2 captures 17.3%** of remaining variance
- Together they capture most important patterns

```
Total variance captured: 92.2%
```

- **Lost only 7.8%** of information by reducing from 4D to 2D
- Excellent compression with minimal information loss

```
Reconstruction error: 0.163559
```

- **Low error** means good approximation of original data
- Can recover most of original information from 2D representation

## Mathematical Foundation

### Core Principle

PCA finds orthogonal directions where data varies the most:

1. **Center the data**: Subtract mean from each feature
2. **Compute covariance matrix**: Measures how features vary together
3. **Find eigenvalues/eigenvectors**: Principal components and their importance
4. **Transform data**: Project onto principal component directions

### What PCA Does Mathematically

```
Original Data (4D) → Principal Components → Reduced Data (2D)
```

- **Input**: X (6×4 matrix)
- **Output**: X_pca (6×2 matrix)
- **Components**: 2 orthogonal directions that capture most variance

## Understanding Variance Explanation

### Why 92.2% is Good

- **High retention**: Kept most important information
- **Efficient compression**: 4D → 2D with minimal loss
- **Meaningful reduction**: Removed mostly noise/redundancy

### Component Importance

- **PC1 (74.9%)**: Primary direction of data variation
- **PC2 (17.3%)**: Secondary pattern, orthogonal to PC1
- **Remaining (7.8%)**: Less important variations (removed)

## Reconstruction Process

PCA is **reversible** (with some loss):

1. **Forward**: Original 4D → Reduced 2D
2. **Inverse**: Reduced 2D → Approximate 4D
3. **Error**: Measures information lost in compression

Low reconstruction error = good dimensionality reduction
